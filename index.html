        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>
          I absolutely love playing sports, with basketball and football being at the top of my list. 
          There's just something exhilarating about being on the field or court, competing and giving it my all. On the flip side, I'm also a bit of a gaming enthusiast. 
          I can spend hours immersed in games like CSGO, Valorant, and NBA 2K, where I can put my strategic thinking and skills to the test. 
          It's a great way to unwind and have fun. Outside of sports and gaming, I'm all about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. 
          Working out is a big part of my routine, helping me stay in shape and feel my best. And when I'm not breaking a sweat, you'll often find me diving into the world of programming.
          So, whether I'm on the court, in front of my computer, or hitting the gym, I'm always up for new challenges and experiences.

          <h4>Summer 2023:</h4>
          This summer I had an IT internship at Bluerock Therapeutics in Cambridge, MA, from May to August 2023, I played a pivotal role in enhancing the organization's technological infrastructure and support services. 
          My responsibilities included utilizing Atera and Freshworks ticketing systems to efficiently address and manage issues for scientists and colleagues, ensuring seamless problem resolution and support. 
          I demonstrated a high level of proficiency in Microsoft Azure and Office 365 administration, leveraging cloud-based solutions and collaboration tools to facilitate productivity and efficient teamwork.
          Additionally, I took charge of managing approximately 350 user accounts through Active Directory, guaranteeing streamlined access and robust security measures for all team members. 
          My contributions as an IT intern significantly contributed to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of Bluerock Therapeutics' IT operations during my tenure.
